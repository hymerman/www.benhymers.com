			<h3>Experience</h3>
			<p>I graduated from Warwick University in 2007, with a 1st class MEng in Computer Science. I went straight from this into a job at Rare Ltd., where I currently work as a Gameplay Software Engineer, programming for the Xbox 360 and Kinect. I worked on the very successful Kinect Sports as the main gameplay engineer on table tennis, and had worked on various prototypes before that.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="skills" class="subsection grid_4">
			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>I consider myself highly skilled in C++, but I could learn any language I need to. I have also used C#, Java and Python. All of my professional experience is with C++ on the Xbox 360, but in my own time I also develop for Windows and Linux PCs.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="style" class="subsection grid_4">
			<h3>Style</h3>
			<p>In general, I would say my style is modern and disciplined, but pragmatic. I'm always looking for ways to improve what I do, and have no problem spending time revamping anything that's not perfect. Change is good. The pragmatic side of me knows the cost of change and of other priorities though, so I know when something is "good enough".</p>

		<div id="interests1" class="subsection grid_6">
			<h3>Areas of interest</h3>
			<p>The thing I enjoy most is gameplay programming. To me, that's game logic, controls, cameras, AI, physics, animation: all the bits that define the 'fun' of the experience. Iterating quickly on prototypes with a designer or by myself, or polishing and tweaking things until they shine - it's all brilliant.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="interests2" class="subsection grid_6">
			<h3>&nbsp;</h3><!-- to get things to align nicely -->
			<p>I'm also interested in the development process side of things: continuous integration, automated testing, project management, and so on. It's completely different to the creative job of gameplay programming, but there's a strange part of me that craves organisation too!</p>

			<h3>Cities in the Sky</h3>
			<p>Cities in the Sky is a game about building on a floating island whilst keeping it balanced, and keeping the little people living on it alive.</p>
			<p>I've been developing it on and off since I was at university; it was originally intended as a portfolio piece but now serves more as a sort of test-bed for my development ideas. It is still progressing as a game of course, just very slowly due to my day job and due to me testing out new things on it!</p>
			<p>It's written in C++, using several middleware libraries (OGRE, Bullet, irrKlang, OIS). The 'engine' part of it is a separate library, 'bengine' (I know), which is also in use by Banditos. It has a very flexible game object system based around components, which I have spent a lot of time designing and implementing.</p>
			<p>I'm the only programmer on CITS, and I'm also doing the modelling, texturing, rigging, animation, 2D art, sound and music. I figure it's an excellent way to get a deep understanding of the whole of the game development process!</p>

			<h3>Banditos vs. Federales</h3>
			<p>A local multiplayer stealth game, pitting a team of banditos trying to steal everything they can, against a team of federales trying to stop them.</p>
			<p>Banditos vs. Federales is a game I am developing with some colleagues from Rare, outside of work, for a bit of fun. We're massive fans of local multiplayer games, especially cooperative games with competitive undertones. Banditos was born out of the need for a perfect lunchtime game to play at work!</p>
			<p>Like CITS, Banditos is programmed in C++ using several middleware libraries, tied together using bengine. The flexibility of bengine's object system means programming gameplay is mostly a case of writing script-like components, and composing objects from those.</p>

			<h3>Kinect Sports</h3>
			<p>Kinect Sports is the current #1 sports game for the Xbox Kinect sensor, which at the time of writing has sold around 2.76 million copies <a href="http://gamrreview.vgchartz.com/sales/45607/kinect-sports/">according to VGChartz</a>.</p>
			<p>I worked on Kinect Sports as a gameplay engineer, working solely on the table tennis, one of the six sports included. I was the only programmer working on the sport full-time, but there was one other programmer working on it regularly.</p>
			<p>On table tennis, I wrote the Kinect gestures, game logic, AI, animation, physics, and plenty of other assorted bits that needed doing. It was of course a massive challenge since programming for Kinect is a genuinely new area of technology, but the reviews and sales indicate that I did well :).</p>
			<p>It feels good knowing that I am literally one of the most experienced Kinect gesture programmers in the world, having been involved in Kinect Sports and various unreleased prototypes from a very early stage.</p>
